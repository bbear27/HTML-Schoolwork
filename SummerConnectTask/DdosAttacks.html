        <h2>
            <p>A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt a targeted 
            <br>server's, service's, or network's normal traffic by flooding the target or its surrounding infrastructure with 
            <br>Internet traffic. DDoS assaults are effective because they use several compromised computer systems as attack traffic sources.
            <br> Computers and other networked resources, such as IoT devices,are examples of exploited machinery.
            <br>
            <br>A DDoS assault is analogous to unanticipated traffic congestion obstructing the roadway, preventing
            <br> ordinary traffic from reaching its destination.
