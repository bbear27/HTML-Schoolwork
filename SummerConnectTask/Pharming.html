    <p><h2>Pharming is a sort of social engineering hack in which attackers lead internet visitors seeking a certain website to a different, 
    <br>bogus site. These "spoof" sites are designed to steal a victim's personal information, such as passwords, 
    <br>social security numbers, account numbers, and so on, or to install pharming malware on their machine. 
    <br>Pharmers frequently target financial-related websites, such as banks, online payment systems, 
    <br>and e-commerce sites, with the goal of stealing personal information.</h2></p>
