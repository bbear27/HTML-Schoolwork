            Authentication is the process of making sure the person behind the screen is 
            actually the owner of the account. Entering a username and password while logging 
            in to a website is a popular example. 
            Entering the right login credentials informs the website of 
            <ol>
                <li> who you are and</li>
                <li>that you are the one who is visiting the website.</li>
            </ol>
