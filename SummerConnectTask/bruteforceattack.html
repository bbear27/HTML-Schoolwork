    <p><h2>A brute force attack is a type of hacking that employs trial and error 
        <br>to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys. It is a simple
        <br> yet dependable method for gaining unauthorised access to individual accounts 
        <br>as well as systems and networks of organisations.
         <br>   The hacker tries a variety of usernames and passwords,
        <br>frequently using a computer to test a large number of combinations 
        <br>until they find the correct login information.
        
        The term "brute force" refers to attackers 
        <br>who use excessive force to gain access to user accounts.
