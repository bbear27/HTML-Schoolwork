            A firewall is a network sequrity tool that checks and selects 
            <br>incoming and outgoing traffic based on previously assigned sequrity rules. A firewall 
            <br>is basically a wall between the network and malicious hackers and software. Its main task 
            <br>is to keep malicious traffic out and dafe traffic in.
